If not specifically locked down, it is possible to invoke the File Open dialog box, via the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O.

Press Ctrl+O and then proceed to these secondary tactics:
 - LotL USB Smuggling Attack
 - Launch Terminal from File Open Dialog Box via Preview Pane
 - Rename LotL or Payload as Msedge

While some of these are easier and more streamlined than others and they all work on Attended Access presenting Edge as of this writing, individual host-hardening policies may apply, and these could vary from one organization to the next (for penetration testers). 

Note that the File Open dialog box seems to offer quite a bit more attack surface, when compared with the File Save dialog box. 

Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate laws and industry ethics / best practices.
