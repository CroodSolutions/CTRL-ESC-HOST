Download LotL Binaries via Browser from Local Host

This test requires the Escape to Less Restrictive Browser step first, if the kiosk is running in a Sign or Interactive Display mode.  

This test simply involves typing a local filepath into the browser bar, with the prefix of file:/// at the beginning.

Here are the basic steps to test:
 - Type a filepath in the browser bar, such as file:///C:/Windows/System32/cmd.exe
 - It will then proceed to download the local file via the browser to downloads, if not blocked.
 - Click the folder icon to open the downloads folder.

Now proceed to Rename LotL or Payload as Msedge.  

Remember: Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate laws and industry ethics / best practices
