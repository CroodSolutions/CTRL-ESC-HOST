It is possible to launch a terminal from the Preview Pane of the File Open dialog box, via right clicking twice.  

Make sure “Select a file to preview” / preview pane is visible, and click to show it, if not.
 - Right click in the preview area, and then click away.
 - Right click a second time in the preview area. 
 - Select “Open in Terminal”

Note, if the double right click option to launch a terminal is unavailable due to host hardening/policies, attempt:
 - LotL USB Smuggling Attack
 - Download LotL Binaries via Brower

Then, attempt the Rename LotL or Payload as Msedge to launch.  

Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate laws and industry ethics / best practices
