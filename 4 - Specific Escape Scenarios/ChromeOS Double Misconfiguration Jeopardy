## Kiosks Crossing Trust Boundaries

When is a kiosk, more than just a kiosk?  

On one hand, if we escape a boundary provided for a library kiosk, only to find the real protection is that the entire network and domain are isolated - is a kiosk escape important? Probably not. 

On the other hand, what if we have a ChromeOS display kiosk, feeding data supplied from a sensitive network (e.g., OT), while in an exposed zone with physical access. Usually hacking kiosks is for amusement, but occasionally it may have practical implications.
