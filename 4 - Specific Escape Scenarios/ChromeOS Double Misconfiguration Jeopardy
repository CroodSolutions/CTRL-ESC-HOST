#Kiosks Crossing Trust Boundaries

## When is a kiosk, more than just a kiosk?  

On one hand, if we escape a boundary provided for a library kiosk, only to find the real protection is that the entire network and domain are isolated - is a kiosk escape important? Probably not. 

On the other hand, what if we have a display kiosk, feeding data supplied from a sensitive network/on that network (e.g., OT), while in an exposed zone with physical access? Usually hacking kiosks is for Lolz, but occasionally it may have practical implications. For example, imagine a provider of water or power services, with kiosks in public 'tour group' areas that are actually on OT, or even important IT networks? 

Could it be significant if someone escaped the kiosk to load an RMM, only to circle back later and attack any network zones or domain joins, exposed by that kiosk?  This becomes significant, because we often fall back on the notion that we are ok, because there are cameras and guards. In testing, we are clumsy and slow, but our enemies have lab environments and would carefully rehearse any real attack. So my test where I fumble about for an hour, for a real attacker in a high value scenario, may be rehearsed and reduced down to a minute or two... we could do that; we just don't because we live in the land of POC or GTFO, do not actually commit crimes, and as such in our closest attempts at adversary emulation, still remain different.  

### Defining Kiosk Types  

The first step in kiosk hacking, is to figure out what what type of kiosk it is and what OS is running. For this particular scenario, we knew in advance it was a ChromeOS kiosk, although this could have been figured out eventually via keyboard combinations or visual inspection of the appliance that was running.
