# Exploit Walkthrough: Chromium Kiosk Breakout via Thunderbird

**Objective:** Escalate from a restricted Chromium Kiosk browser to full interactive Shell Access.
**Prerequisites:** A Linux system running Chromium in Kiosk mode with Thunderbird installed as the default `mailto` handler.

---

## Step 1: The Trigger
The entry point is a standard `mailto:` link found on a support page or "Contact Us" footer.

1.  Navigate to the target "Contact" page.
2.  Click the `mailto:admin@company.com` link.
3.  Observe that **Thunderbird** opens in a new window, overlaid on top of the Kiosk browser.

## Step 2: The Pivot
We are now out of the browser context, but inside a Mail client. We need to reach the filesystem.

1.  In the Thunderbird window, locate the **Hamburger Menu (≡)** in the top right.
2.  Select **Help** > **Troubleshooting Information**.
    *   *Note: Do not select "About", as it often provides fewer interaction points.*

## Step 3: The Breakout
The "Troubleshooting Information" tab contains diagnostic data, including paths to local files.

1.  Scroll down to the **Application Basics** table.
2.  Locate the row labeled **Profile Directory**.
3.  Click the button **[Open Directory]**.

**Research Note:** This button does not simply "show" the folder inside Thunderbird. It fires a DBus call to the system's default File Manager (Nautilus, Thunar, PCManFM, etc.), forcing the OS to spawn a *third* application window. This new window is a fully functional File Manager, unbound by the Kiosk's original rules.

## Step 4: The Shell
We now have full read/write access to the file system via the GUI File Manager.

1.  In the File Manager window, right-click on whitespace in the directory view.
2.  Select **"Open Terminal Here"** from the context menu.

**Alternative Methods (If Context Menu is Locked):**
*   **Drag & Drop:** Navigate to `/usr/bin/`, find `gnome-terminal` (or `xterm`), and drag the executable into the Chromium window. Sometimes this triggers a download/run prompt.
*   **Bashrc Poisoning:** If you cannot launch a terminal directly but have write access to `/home/kiosk/`, edit `.bashrc` to spawn a reverse shell on next login, then force a logout/reboot (if accessible).

**Success:** You should now have an interactive terminal window.
