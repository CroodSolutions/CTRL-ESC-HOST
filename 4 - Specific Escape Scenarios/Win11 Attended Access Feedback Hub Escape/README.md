Looking for a way to escape Windows 11 Single App Kiosk Mode / Attended Access?  

After some testing, Ezra Woods and I found some fun and interesting ways to Escape-to-Host, including one we will showcase here. It turns out, if you select Win+F it will escape to launch Microsoft Feedback Hub, a cool and interesting place to give MS feedback.  And, it seems like Microsoft trusts this feedback so much, they are willing to give you a terminal.  

•	Here are the basic steps for this kiosk escape:

•	Win+F (Launch Feedback Hub)

•	Click “+ Give new feedback”

•	Add some random text to “Summarize your feedback” and click “Next”

•	Select “Suggestion” or “Problem” and click “Next”

•	Click “Next”

•	Select “Attach a file”

•	Make sure “Select a file to preview” / preview pane is visible, and click to show it, if not.

•	Right click in the preview area, and then click away.

•	Right click a second time in the preview area. 

•	Select “Open in Terminal”

Footnote:
In the short demo video, recorded as a teaser for our new Ctrl+Esc+Host framework, I speculated that Feedback Hub was new; further research shows it has been around for some time, although this escape seems like it could be the result of a recent update (adding some retro-active testing to our to-do list, to eventually determine how far back it goes).
