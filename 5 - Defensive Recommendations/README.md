This is a placeholder, for the section of the project that will eventually contain robust recommendations for defense against escape to host scenarios. 

As a starting point though, segment and isolate. Assume it is possible to escape to host, even if you do not have a specific POC allowing you to do so (yet). As defenders, we need to act and plan accordingly.
